# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep amaniquery secure. This document explains how to report security vulnerabilities, what to include in reports, and how we handle disclosures.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Preferred: Create a private Security Advisory on this repository so we can coordinate privately:
https://github.com/Benaah/amaniquery/security/advisories

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, contact the maintainer via their GitHub profile: https://github.com/Benaah


## What to include in your report

Please include the following information when reporting a potential vulnerability:
- Affected component(s) and version(s)
- Clear description of the issue and impact
- Step-by-step reproduction steps or a minimal proof-of-concept
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Any relevant logs, stack traces, or screenshots
- Your preferred disclosure timeline and contact method

If you can provide a patch or suggested remediation, that is helpful but not required.

## Response and disclosure policy

- Acknowledge receipt within 3 business days.
- Triage and initial assessment within 7 calendar days.
- We aim to provide a remediation timeline or fix within 30 days depending on severity and complexity.

Coordinated disclosure: We prefer to work with reporters to coordinate disclosure. If no timeline is agreed, we may disclose publicly after a fixed period (typically 90 days) following responsible disclosure norms.

## Scope

In-scope:
- Code in this repository (amaniquery)
- Releases published from this repository

Out-of-scope:
- Third-party services, dependencies, or infrastructure not maintained in this repository — report those to the respective vendor.
- Issues in forks or other repositories (report to the owner of that repository).

## Safe harbor

We welcome responsible security research. If you follow this policy and act in good faith, we will not initiate legal action against security researchers who report issues responsibly and avoid privacy-invasive or destructive actions.

## Credit

We appreciate reports and will credit researchers who request it, unless they ask to remain anonymous. If you prefer to be credited, please state the name or handle you want used.

## PGP

Optional: If you would like to share sensitive information via encrypted email, provide your PGP public key and we will use it to encrypt our response. If you want the project to publish a PGP key for encrypted submissions, tell us where to add it.
