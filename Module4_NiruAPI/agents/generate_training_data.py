Maana yake: Ukituma pesa kwa bank ama insurance, utakuwa unalipa tax zaidi. Kama analogy, ni kama vile mama mboga anapoongeza bei ya sukuma - hii pia ni ongezeko la bei kwa banking. Article 228 ya Katiba inasema Parliament ndio inaweza ku-approve taxes za national government, na hii Finance Bill ndiyo wanatumia ku-implement hiyo power."

As a revenue-raising measure enacted by Parliament through the Finance Bill (which becomes the Finance Act upon Presidential assent), it satisfies the constitutional requirement.\n\nHowever, this must also comply with Article 201(b)(i) requiring that 'the burden of taxation shall be shared fairly.' Legal challenges to the Housing Levy may argue whether a flat 3% rate on all employees meets this constitutional test of fairness, particularly regarding lower-income earners."
